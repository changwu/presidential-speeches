# There's also http://flesh.sourceforge.net/index.html, but although
# it claims to be licensed under the GPL, I can't find source code
# anywhere.  It's also older than textastic, written in Java, and
# doesn't seem to have any public version controlled home online.
# There's http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/ too, which is used for
